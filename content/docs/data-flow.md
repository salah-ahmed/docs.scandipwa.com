```

## Who are the main actors?

-   **A** – Component
    -   Naming convention: `Feature.component.js`
    -   Implements the data display functional
-   **B** – Container
    -   Naming convention: `Feature.container.js`
    -   Relates the component with Redux global state
-   **E** – Utility / Helper function
    -   Naming convention: `Helper.js`
    -   Utility functional which implements the common logic
-   **GraphQL server**
    -   The Magento 2, working via the GraphQL API

Following parts (after the **NOTE #1**), are only involved if the global state update is required:

-   **unmentioned** – Action Declaration
    -   Naming convention: `Feature.action.js`
    -   Declare action interface (arguments and returned values)
-   **C** – Action Dispatcher
    -   Naming convention: `Feature.dispatcher.js`
    -   Dispatches the Redux global state actions
-   **D** – Action Reducer
    -   Naming convention: `Feature.reducer.js`
    -   Handles the state update, applies Redux action results to global state

## What is going on?

> **Note**:
>
> the passthrough to the Redux is not obligatory, I would say it is an anti-pattern. You must only involve the Redux (global state), if more than one or two components in completely different places of application must know about that. The best examples are: `cart`, `account`. ScandiPWA has some redundant states in it. Their amount will be reduced in the future.

1.  User input (`User -> A`)
2.  Global state changing user interaction (`A -> B`)
3.  Event payload is passed to asynchronous action dispatcher (`B -> C`)
4.  Helpers are invoked (`C -> E`)
5.  Asynchronous response is returned from helper (`E -> C`)
6.  Action is dispatched (`C -> D`, `B -> D`)
7.  Action result updates the state (`D -> B`)
8.  Container updates props of child component (`B -> A`)
