## What is the development time for PWA web app instead of Native app?

The development of a PWA for your store is much quicker and so much more affordable than developing a native app. Apps can have a higher barrier to entry as your customers will need to head to their application store to download and install your app and wait for it to download.

Bonus: PWAs can also be added to app stores for greater discoverability.

## How PWA web app upgrades differ from Native app?

PWAs are programmed in one language and work across all devices while for Native apps you also have to take into account different operating systems (Apple, Android, etc.).
You don’t need to bother with app publishing/update limitations from the major app stores. Updates to your PWA are live as soon as they are published.

## Does PWAs get indexed by Google?

Yes! PWAs are websites – so they can be indexed and ranked by Google, while apps can’t! So let your SEO shine and get that sweet organic traffic.

## Can I launch a not PG-only store using PWA?

If you own an “unconventional” online store you can run into issues getting apps or online ads approved, think tobacco, vape, or sex stores. With PWAs you are free to do your thing.

## Who already uses PWA?

You may have heard that Amazon is using a PWA.
And Alibaba.
And Uber.
To put it simply, PWAs are the best choice right now for eCommerce. The benefits and results are immeasurable.

Another strong indication is Google’s adoption of PWA. Google is pushing PWA really, really hard. Google even prioritizes search engine positions to PWA sites, so your SEO and organic search traffic would improve. By not switching to PWA you are at risk of losing your position in Google to competitors.
