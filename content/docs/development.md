## Understand important changes when upgrading ScandiPWA versions

All the important changes with each release are listed in GitHub under the [GitHub Release important notes section](https://github.com/scandipwa/base-theme/releases).

You can also compare two tags using [GitHub compare functionality](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/comparing-commits).

General advice for easier upgrade process is to extend the code and keep the pure override count low. Extend original classes in overrides, do not copy them.

## Where is the correct place to install a new font for the base theme?

Fonts should be installed in the theme public folder and in index.development.html

2. Change webpack import for it
3. Add your new fonts there

## Does ScandiPWA plan to implement TypeScript?

The core will not migrate to TypeScript in a relatively long term. The extensions however - might be done in any language. This is because of the learning curve needed for TypeScript. We prefer simplier technology - most M2 developer are relatively unexperienced with JavaScript. The interfaces and some TypeScript based components might come with UI library in the future. It is important step for extensions, as there is a need to depend on some abstraction when writing an extension.

## ERROR: no such file or directory, open '.../Scandiweb/pwa/package.json'

<!-- ## What is the best practice to implement a new module between Magento and ScandiPWA?

You should develop using [ScandiPWA plugin mechanism](http://docs.scandipwa.com/docs/development/plugin-mechanism/). -->

## How ScandiPWA manages cache?

1. Utilizes default Magento 2 cache control mechanism over X-Magento-Tags-Pattern header.
2. Provides AddTagsToResponsePlugin to add entity headers to each GraphQl cacheable response.
3. Utilizes custom Cache entity (singleton), to gather all entities, that were loaded during current request.
4. Flush happens based on default cache_flush events for most entities.
5. CMS pages has own event observers to track response/flush.
